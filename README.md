# Analytics & Visualization Samples for Academic Graph 

This project aims to help data scientists become familar with the Microsoft Academic Graph through analystics and visualization samples using Data Lake Analytics (USQL) and Power BI.  

## Samples

The project contains 13 samples

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

* [Get Microsoft Academic Graph on Azure Storage](get-started-setup-provisioning.md)
* [Set up Azure Data Lake Analytics for Microsoft Academic Graph](get-started-setup-azure-data-lake-analytics.md)
* [Microsoft Power BI Desktop client](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/)
* Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio 2015 with [Data Lake tools](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49504)

### Quickstart

#### Overview
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the solution /src/AcademicAnalytics.sln
3. Take a look at the academic graph data schema and run CreateDatabase.usql from [common scripts](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/academic-knowledge-analytics-visualization/tree/master/src/AcademicAnalytics/00.%20Common%20Scripts)
4. For each tutorial there should be: A USQL script(.usql), a Power BI report(.pbix), a Power BI template(.pbit) and a README explaining the tutorial. 
5. Althought each tutorial is different, running the USQL script as is and filling out the Power BI template using the same USQL parameters should give you a Power BI report with visualizations that match the Power BI report example included in the tutorial. Since the Microsoft Academic graph is contently improving, different graph verions may give you slightly different results.

#### Working with USQL scripts 
- How to run
    - Make sure you have selected your ADLA account


    ![Select your ADLA Account in Visual Studio](images/VSSelectADLAAccount.png)

    - Build the script first to validate syntax


    ![Build USQL script in Visual Studio](images/VSBuildScript.png)

    - Submit your script to your ADLA account


    ![Submit USCQL script in Visual Studio](images/VSSubmitScript.png)

- How to view the results
    - You can view the results via azure portal

#### Using Power BI 
- Make sure USQL script finished sucessfully
- Open up corresponding Power BI Template(.pbit) from file explorer (Visual studio doesn't recognize Power BI files) 
- Enter your ADL information and parameters corrisponding to your scripts
![Sample template load](/images/PBITemplateInitParam.png)
- Make sure the parameters cases are the same as your script and "click" to load
